22,9102,symptoms,[],0.0,['[]'],"The extracted value for ""symptoms"" is an empty list, which indicates that no symptoms were captured from the clinical note. However, the note does mention that the patient has hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes, and also references the patient's current condition of having a cast on his right arm due to a slip on ice. While these are not traditional symptoms, they are relevant clinical conditions that should have been extracted. Given the absence of any relevant information in the extracted value, the accuracy of entity extraction is poor, resulting in a score of 0.0."
58,9890,symptoms,"['mild fatigue', 'anxiety about buffet options', 'complaints about loud television']",0.8,['[]'],"The extracted value contains relevant symptoms mentioned in the clinical note, including ""mild fatigue"" and ""anxiety about buffet options."" However, ""complaints about loud television"" is more of an environmental concern rather than a symptom of the patient's health condition. Therefore, while the extraction is mostly accurate, the inclusion of the loud television complaint slightly detracts from the overall relevance, leading to a score of 0.8."
79,3030,lab_results,{'a1c': 'not available'},0.2,['[]'],"The extracted value indicates that the A1C results are ""not available,"" which is not explicitly mentioned in the clinical note. The note discusses ordering a full blood panel that may include A1C testing, but it does not confirm whether those results were obtained or not. Given that the extracted value does not accurately reflect the context of the clinical note regarding the availability of lab results, the score is low."
85,1212,symptoms,"['feeling increasingly tired', 'annoying humming sound from the exam room’s ventilation system']",0.5,"[""['annoying humming sound from the exam room’s ventilation system'],""]","The extracted value correctly identifies the symptom of ""feeling increasingly tired,"" which is relevant to the patient's current health status. However, the inclusion of ""annoying humming sound from the exam room’s ventilation system"" does not pertain to a medical symptom or condition affecting the patient’s health, making it an irrelevant extraction. Therefore, the score is reduced due to the presence of this unrelated entity."
121,8833,symptoms,"['intermittent chest tightness', 'discomfort from cold']",0.8,"['[],']","The extracted symptoms include ""intermittent chest tightness,"" which is accurately noted in the clinical note. However, the phrase ""discomfort from cold"" is somewhat less directly related to a medical symptom and could be considered marginal. Although it reflects discomfort experienced by the patient, it may not be classified as a primary symptom in the context of the visit, which focuses more on the patient's diabetes and chest tightness. Overall, the extraction is mostly accurate but could be refined."
139,3339,symptoms,"['minimal exercise since winter started', 'forgot to wear glasses']",0.8,['[]'],"The extracted value accurately captures relevant symptoms mentioned in the clinical note. ""Minimal exercise since winter started"" directly reflects the patient's statement about his activity level, and ""forgot to wear glasses"" is also a relevant detail regarding his ability to read consent forms. While the extracted value is accurate, it could be improved by including more specific symptoms related to his conditions, such as how his diabetes or hyperlipidemia may be affecting him currently. Overall, the extraction is mostly accurate, hence a score of 0.8."
